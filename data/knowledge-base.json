The procedure involves removing infected pulp, cleaning and filling the root canal, often over multiple visits. Local anaesthetic is used, and the treatment is generally painless. Crowns are often recommended after treatment to strengthen the tooth. If treatment fails, options include apicectomy or extraction.\n\n- White Fillings: Natural-looking alternatives to amalgam fillings, including composite, glass ionomer, and compomer types. The procedure involves numbing, decay removal, etching, bonding, curing with UV light, and polishing. Benefits include aesthetics and less tooth preparation.\n\n- Crowns: Replacement caps for damaged or discoloured teeth, made from porcelain, gold, or porcelain-fused-to-metal. The process involves tooth preparation, impression taking, temporary crown placement, and final cementation. Crowns restore function and appearance and can last up to 40 years.\n\n- Dental Bridges: Fixed prosthetics to replace one or more missing teeth by anchoring to adjacent teeth. Types include traditional (requiring tooth preparation) and adhesive (Maryland) bridges. Alternatives include dental implants.\n\n- Dental Hygiene: Professional cleaning to remove plaque and calculus, prevent gum disease and bad breath. Evening appointments available until 20:00 on Wednesdays and 18:00 on Thursdays. Direct access hygienist sessions are offered without needing to be a regular patient."
